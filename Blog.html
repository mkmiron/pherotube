            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
          </h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript variables, declared with var, let, and const, have
            distinct scopes and behaviors. var has function scope, permitting
            visibility within functions or globally, with hoisting and
            re-declaration capabilities. In contrast, let and const introduce
            block-scoping, confining variables to their respective blocks and
            discouraging hoisting. let allows reassignment, while const enforces
            constant values after initialization.
            <br/>
            In modern JavaScript, it's recommended to use let for reassignable
            variables and const for constants to enhance code clarity and
            reliability. Understanding these scoping rules is pivotal for
            writing robust JavaScript applications.

            Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
          </h2>
          <p>
            null serves as a deliberate indicator of the absence of a value
            within JavaScript. It's commonly utilized when you want to
            explicitly communicate that a variable or property does not contain
            a meaningful value. For example, you might assign null to a variable
            at its initialization to convey that it's meant to eventually hold
            an object but currently lacks a valid object to assign. This can be
            especially useful for indicating intentional emptiness in your code,
            allowing for clearer communication of your intentions.
            <br/>
            On the other hand, undefined represents variables or properties that
            have been declared but have not yet been assigned a value. It often
            acts as a default state, such as when function parameters are left
            undefined because no argument was provided during a function call.
            undefined can also signify missing object properties or the outcome
            of expressions that do not return a value. It's a common indicator
            of coding errors or uninitialized variables, helping developers
            identify issues within their code and ensure proper variable
            assignment and initialization.

          What do you mean by REST API?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A REST API, or simply a RESTful API, is a way for software applications to talk to each other over the internet. It uses a set of rules and URLs to access and exchange data, making it a standard method for sharing information between different programs on the web.
